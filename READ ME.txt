'WORGEN' is a program that will help you with your personal and random wordlist preparation.

 If you want,
you can start using the program directly with the '-u' command.
After typing this command, you will  have two options:

1. By selecting the letter (l) option, you can process the letters that you want among themselves.

(NOTE: if your alphabet is different, or if you don't want to permutate all uppercase letters and all lowercase letters, etc.,
or if you have special letters to include in the process, answer all questions as 'No' (N)
after selecting the letter option, Do you want to add anything? 'to the question' Yes' (Y),
you can manually enter your own characters or special letters and permutate it.)
(In case you prefer this path, be careful, you do not need to type a space between letters or write any characters. Correct example is: abcd258.,! -)

2. After selecting the option words (w), you can set the maximum and minimum combinations as you wish, after entering 1-30 keywords about the victim, you can start the permutation progress.

(NOTE: You do not need to enter random numbers in the keywords section. Just say yes to the question
'Would you like to add a random number?'
(Note:In case you want to enter less than 30 words, you can press enter and pass the blank word questions.
The blank words and duplicates will be deleted.)



If you want to process more than 30 words, write as many keywords as you want in a text file.
Then, you can continue the operation after typing '-w' and entering it you must write the filename with the type of the file.Then enter the maximum and minimum number of permutations.
In this method, you can enter maximum' 6 'in the maximum permutation section.)
And please, write words for each line in your wordlist



Besides all these, you can see which version you are using by typing the' -v 'command.
